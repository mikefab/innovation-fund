    "<p>The Innovation Fund is a pooled funding vehicle to quickly assess, fund and scale open-source solutions that have been developed in new and emerging markets.  The Fund has raised $9 million so far and focuses its investments on three portfolio areas: products for youth, real-time information and infrastructure. These portfolio areas encompass a set of technologies and initiatives that are fundamental to increasing children’s access to information, opportunity and choice. The Fund brings together models of financing and methodologies used by Venture Capital funds and the principles of UNICEF's award winning Office of Innovation. \n<p> UNICEF Innovation is creating communities around the products we invest in. Having access to robust communities of developers and entrepreneurs is also of value to our partners. It will allow them to extend work for their own purposes and also access a global change engine that can be used to build other solutions in the future.</p>\n \n <p>This website provides investors, supporters and other partners with real-time information about the Innovation Fund. This site is currently a beta version and we are continuing to build, improve and grow it. The website allows for exploration of individual projects and tracking of the overall portfolio in real time. Through dashboards that provide real time information aggregated at the project, portfolio and Fund level, contributors, and investors are able to continually monitor progress.</p>"
