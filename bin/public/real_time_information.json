MomConnect is an SMS-based maternal reminder program in South Africa for pregnant women. This investment supports the scale up of MomConnect by building the technology to make it part of the RapidPro suite of tools, allowing it to be more quickly and widely distributed worldwide. These alterations include: ability for counselors to send pre-written responses to incoming queries, and several usability features to make the tool better suited for the help desk use case. These additions will also enable counseling services using RapidPro.",

UNICEF Maldives has created a mobile application that is linked to the “Call Centre” and the Maldives Child Protection Database. The information from both the calls and SMS, would be centrally captured, analyzed and used for timely response and action. Thus, enabling the social workers to respond to cases in a timely manner."
